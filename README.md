After the assassination of President Jackson some five years ago, acting President Calhoun faced a significant crisis when South Carolina declared the Tariff of 1828 nullified. Despite opposition from Congress, he recognized this action as constitutional and opened pandora's box, reducing the power of the federal government to the point where today the individual states are borderline independent. Will this spell the end of the American experiment, be a temporary setback, or begin the rise of one of the disunited states in their own right?

## Features
**Choose your own history:** In the decisions menu at the start of a new game, you can decide whether Calhoun's actions have lead to the total collapse of the federal government or if it is hanging on by its last thread at game start. Most of the current mod content revolves around the United States attempting to consolidate rule but in the future content for the individual states will be expanded on.

**New nations for 24 states:** All states admitted before game start have been added to the game as dominions. These include Maine, New Hampshire, Vermont, Rhode Island, Connecticut, New York, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Ohio, Indiana, Illinois, Missouri, Kentucky, Virginia, Delaware, Maryland, North Carolina, Tennessee, South Carolina, Georgia, Alabama, Mississippi, and Louisiana. They all include their own unique laws, flags, historical leaders, and a new government type to recognize their status as American states. They can conduct their own diplomacy, change their own laws, declare independence, experience civil wars, and most everything else a country in Victoria 3 can do. If Texas joins the United States, it will be converted to this new government type and function as the others do.

**26 new cultures:** To recognize in the lore of this mod a weak national identity, every state + Texas and the District of Columbia has its own culture. States are not monolithic in their culture, but contain most or all of the other American cultures based on historical data of the place of birth of residents at game start. These populations while all accepted at game start migrate and are up to the whims of the laws of the individual states. Dixie and Yankee still exist as cultures of the frontier, or if one successfully completes the...

**Consolidation journal entry:** Recognizing the precarious position the United States is in during this mod, a U.S. player (who isn't here to watch the world burn) will have to act to annex all of the individual states. Upon doing such, they will be able to reunite the United States and get an event to convert all individual state pops to Yankee and Dixie. On the flip side if one loses control of more than 8 states or faces extreme domestic instability, the government will be forced to dissolve.

**Dynamic Civil War:** The American Civil War has been completely overhauled in this mod. Both the South and North can secede depending on U.S. policy, and each individual state will join or not join based on their laws and interest groups. For example, states which have the Southern Planters in government and have not banned slavery will join a Confederate revolt. The rebelling nation will spawn similarly to D.C. in an individual city in one of the states that seceded, and the seceding states will become its puppets. To win the American Civil War one does not need to full annex the rebelling states, only to take enough states in the peace deal that the U.S. is above the 16 state threshold to not collapse. The rest of the rebelling states will be annexed immediately after by event. This is due to a restriction in how Victoria 3 processes wars between multiple parties. Reconstruction events have also been altered to recognize the new cultures.

**New diplomatic action: Assume State Debt:** As part of the process of consolidating the United States, a new diplomatic action has been added. When a state is significantly in debt, the USA (or even the CSA/FSA if they won) can choose to assume that state's debt in exchange for their annexation. This will likely be an important part of the game if you wish to unite the United States.
